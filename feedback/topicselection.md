# Topic Selection

As you might guess from the title of this repo, I settled on a project focused around scores for board games.

## Initial Topics

I started my quest with 3 questions, with the first being the question I wanted to research the most. Below are those questions:

1. What makes a board game popular? (With plans of using primarily Board Game Geek's API)
2. What are the most common tropes for D&D characters? (With plans of scraping character sheet information from the web)
3. Does switching to daylight savings affect the number of crashes that occur? (With plans of downloading data from Utah's records, especially Provo since that's where I do a good chunk of driving)

I got feedback from a few classmates, all supporting the first question. Spencer liked the first question, felt the second would be applicable to too narrow of an audience, and didn't expect anything of note from the third. Tyler felt the first question was the appropriate scope. Jacob felt the first one could help people find out what they like in games.

It's hard to turn down helping people get more into board games, so I selected the first game. Who doesn't like looking at the list of highest rated games and seeing which ones they have yet to try?
