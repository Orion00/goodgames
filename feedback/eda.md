# Revising Post

## Initial Post

The initial post is written [here](https://orion00.github.io/tinyproject/2022/12/09/good-games-part-2.html) with commit 43e80fba6a0df0dcf0373ca91c27d606f8f80c3b.

## Feedback

I really liked how you started out with stating the purposes of the post. It quickly tells the reader what they're looking at and focuses the post. Similar to my response in part 1, I loved the way you set up the post in defining the variables and then showing the results. One spell check I noticed in your wrap up: "Honestly THINGS still feel pretty murkyâ€¦" instead of thing. Your visualizations were easy to understand and nice to view and I really liked how it was written and set up. -Mary

The way you organized your sections is awesome! Super easy to navigate the post and I knew from the start what each one was going to talk about. The only thing I saw that you might want to correct is a grammar error in the second sentence of the Wrapup section. Overall great job! -Aaron

I honestly really like your post. Similar to the feedback I gave for part 1 of your blog post, I like how you included your own writing style in the post. It makes it a lot more relatable. I also like how you split up your graphs with some interpretations at relavant points in the blog. It was very easy to read with paragraph splits and the graphs. Great job! -Tyler

This is an excellent post. You gave good explanations on everything that a typical layman may not know. You also gave good interpretation and explanation for the visualizations you created. I would love to see a little more explanation on the correlation graph and why you think variables were and were not correlated. -Jacob

## Revisions to Post

Once again, not too much in the way of things to change in feedback. I fixed the typo in the Wrap Up section (honestly, I expected more typos than I got at the speed I wrote that post).

I added some more rationale to my correlation thinking about list price and avg rating. I thought it was more evident when I wrote it, but apparently it was not as clear as I thought.
