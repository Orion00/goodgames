# Revising Post

## Initial Post

The initial post is written [here](https://github.com/Orion00/tinyproject/blob/main/_posts/2022-11-17-good-games-part-1.md) with commit 9952157733a72fec6377ec08d31e1a6812109bc3.

## Feedback

I loved your style of writing - it was real and fun to read and intriguing, making me want to continue reading to figure out what more you would say. I also really liked how you included links to some of the frequently asked questions. It was a super informative post with links for where I should go if I want to learn more. I thought the way you set it up was super informative: first defining your variables and what you would look into, then showing your visualizations and the key insights that you found from the data. Overall I thought it was really well organized and clear but still comprehensive in your findings. -Mary

I really like how you engage the reader with fun questions and it's definitely an interesting topic. I also like how you added the link to your repository rather than displaying code chunks, it makes the layout more simple and I might have to go back and do that for my own first post haha. That said, I do think it might be more helpful to add just a couple more visuals in between phasesâ€”that way there are good breaks in between paragraphs. Even a simple screenshot of your raw data and then one of your cleaned columns could do the trick! -Aaron

## Revisions to Post

I didn't end up getting much to change on my EDA post. It seems like the style and layout was well liked. I added a screenshot of BGG's ranking table at the beginning and my own finished data at the end to break up the paragraphs and give some more context for what the variables looked like.

I also edited the last sentence to make more sense now that my second post is written.

I sadly only got feedback from two people on this post.
