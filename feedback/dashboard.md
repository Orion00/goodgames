## Feedback

As far as your current dashboard, it also looks good. It's pretty straight forward, but it would be nice if suggestions could be provided as to what variables to plug in to be able to recreate the visuals that you had in your blogpost. You could also, just have those visuals in the dashboard with an explanation of how you got them or could recreate them with the dashboard. -Jacob

It looks awesome so far! I would suggest adding a little bit of information for each graph so that the user can understand what the graph means and how to use it. The last graph especially is a little bit confusing to me. Also, as a bit of a personal preference, I think it could be cool to add another slider for Amazon price on the first graph. It can allow users to find the best games for something in a certain price range. -Tyler

I agree it looks good, but could probably use some information and captions etc. about the data and how it relates to your research question. Also, I'm not sure if this is something possible to fix, but it's hard to enter in the exact game name in the search box with capitalization/punctuation etc., if it had auto complete that would be really helpful -Spencer

## Revisions to Post

I tried to add the autocomplete feature for the filtering game name, but unfortunately I couldn't figure it out. It's either got to be a dropdown box where you can't enter anything besides an exact name (so you only filter to one row each time) or what it is now. So I kept it how it is.

This wasn't really intended to recreate visuals from my blog post, although you could for some of them if you check the x and y axes and use them in the second graph. I don't think I need to do anything here.

I added a price input to filter the first graph so it's easier to see games within a certain budget.

I also fixed a typo I had on the second plot's caption and added a caption to each part of the dashboard.
